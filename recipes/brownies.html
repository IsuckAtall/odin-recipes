      <h4>Instructions</h4>

   <div class="list2">
      <ol> 
       <li>Pre-heat the oven to 350ºF.</li>
       <li> Roll out the pie crust and press it down the bottom and up the sides of a 9 or 9.5” pie dish. Place it in the freezer while you make the brownie batter.</li> 
       <li>Place the butter and 2 cups of chocolate chips in a large bowl. Microwave for 30 second intervals, stirring in between, until the butter and chocolate have completely melted together.</li> 
       <li>Add the Eagle Brand® Sweetened Condensed Milk and whisk until incorporated.</li> 
       <li>Add the brown sugar and whisk.</li> 
       <li>Next, add the eggs, the yolk, and the vanilla, and mix until combined.</li> 
       <li> Sift the flour, cocoa powder, and salt into the bowl and whisk with all the ingredients.</li> 
       <li>Add the 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and stir with a spatula to combine.</li>
            <li> Pour the brownie batter on the bottom of the pie plate. Bake in the pre-heated oven for about 60 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clear when inserted in the brownie.</li>
       <li> Remove the pie from the oven and immediately sprinkle chocolate chips on top if desired, they will melt slightly and stick to the top of the pie, and make for a cute decoration.</li> 
       <li>Place the butter and 2 cups of chocolate chips in a large bowl. Microwave for 30 second intervals, stirring in between, until the butter and chocolate have completely melted together.</li> 
       <li>Add the Eagle Brand® Sweetened Condensed Milk and whisk until incorporated.</li> 
       <li>Let the pie cool down completely before serving.</li> 
       <li>Store the pie on the counter for 1 day, but then place it in the fridge after that, so it stays fresh for longer. When you want to serve a slice, microwave it for 15 seconds or so, and add a scoop of ice cream to the top because it is so delicious that way.</li> 
       <li> You can also serve the pie at room temperature, it is absolutely phenomenal.</li>
