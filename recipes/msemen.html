     <h4 id="faggot">Description</h4>

       <p>Msemen is a fairly flaky, square shaped crispy Moroccan pancake (Rghaif) or flatbread that’s made from a combination of plain wheat flour and semolina. It is eaten for breakfast and also in the evenings with Moroccan Mint Tea (or coffee), and as you’ll see in a bit, can be eaten in so many different ways. </p>
